# Explaining SOLID principle used in this project

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
This system has a single responsibility and focuses on performing one specific task. 
The **LaptopService** class is responsible for handling all the business logic related to laptops, such as adding, updating, and deleting laptops.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
This system is open for extension by creating interfaces for various components. For instance, the **ILaptopService** interface that defines the contract for laptop operations. New features can be added by implementing this interface without modifying the existing code. This promotes code reuse and easy extensibility.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
 The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without altering the correctness of the program. In simpler terms, it means that derived classes should be able to substitute their base classes seamlessly.
 
 In this project, I can demonstrate the Liskov Substitution Principle by having different types of laptops, such as the DellLaptop and HP_Laptop, which inherit from a common base class or interface, let's say Laptop.

Here's an example of who I can apply the LSP:

Define the Laptop base class or interface:
```
public abstract class Laptop
{
    public string SerialNumber { get; set; }
    // Other common properties and methods
}
```
Create derived classes for specific laptop brands:
```
public class DellLaptop : Laptop
{
    // Specific properties and methods for Dell laptops
}

public class HP_Laptop : Laptop
{
    // Specific properties and methods for HP laptops
}
```

Utilize the laptops interchangeably:
```
Laptop dellLaptop = new DellLaptop();
Laptop hpLaptop = new HP_Laptop();

// Use the laptops without knowing their specific types
// They can be treated uniformly as laptops
// For example, you can add them to the inventory or perform other operations

inventory.AddLaptop(dellLaptop);
inventory.AddLaptop(hpLaptop);
```

By following the Liskov Substitution Principle, I ensured that the DellLaptop and HP_Laptop classes can be used interchangeably wherever a Laptop is expected. The system treats them uniformly, allowing substitution without affecting the overall behavior. This promotes code reuse, flexibility, and scalability in your project.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
The interfaces are focused and cater to only the needs of the specific clients or consumers. For instance, the **ILaptopService interface** only expose methods relevant to laptop management, such as AddLaptop, UpdateLaptop, and DeleteLaptop. This avoids unnecessary dependencies and provides a clear contract for each client.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
I have utilized dependency injection and interfaces to achieve dependency inversion. For example, the LaptopController depends on the ILaptopService interface, not concrete implementations. This allows me to inject different implementations.

In my project, I utilized dependency injection and interfaces to achieve dependency inversion. Here's how it can be demonstrated:

Define an interface for the LaptopService:
```
public interface ILaptopService
{
    // Define the methods required for laptop management
    // For example: AddLaptop, UpdateLaptop, DeleteLaptop, etc.
    // This interface acts as an abstraction for the service
    // and provides a contract that concrete implementations must adhere to.
}
```

Implement the LaptopService by implementing the ILaptopService interface:
```
public class LaptopService : ILaptopService
{
    // Implement the methods defined in the ILaptopService interface
    // This class represents the concrete implementation of the laptop service.
    // It handles the actual logic for managing laptops.
}
```

In the LaptopController, depend on the ILaptopService interface instead of the concrete implementation:
```
public class LaptopController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ILaptopService _laptopService;

    public LaptopController(ILaptopService laptopService)
    {
        _laptopService = laptopService;
    }

    // The controller methods can now utilize the _laptopService through the interface
    // without being coupled to a specific implementation.
}
```

By depending on the ILaptopService interface instead of a specific implementation, such as LaptopService, I achieved dependency inversion. This allows me to inject different implementations of the ILaptopService.
